<h1>Email Campaign Automation</h1>

This VBA macro automates the process for generating and sending emails via Microsoft Outlook, perfect for bulk email campaigns. The macro should link to an active Microsoft Word document that is connected to a Microsoft Excel Workbook containing mail merge data. For each email, the macro dynamically inputs email specific details such as recipient, sender address, attachment pathway, subject, security classification, BCC, and CC from the Microsoft Excel Workbook. The code supports attachment inclusion and enables sending emails immediately or saving as drafts. Microsoft Outlook 16 Object Library and Microsoft Scripting Runtime references are required to run this macro.
